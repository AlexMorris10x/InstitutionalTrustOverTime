Looking at institutional trust over time in the United States.

Using both [Pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/05/17/public-trust-in-government-1958-2021/) and [Gallup poll data](https://news.gallup.com/poll/355526/americans-trust-media-dips-second-lowest-record.aspx) and overlaying the two data sets.

What's striking is the contious collapse of instituional trust bottoming out at 20% for governmental trust and 40% for media trust.
